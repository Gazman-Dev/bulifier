- Purpose: Core game logic for Flappy Bird-like game
- Imports:
  - Phaser library (implicit)

- Class: GameScene extends Phaser.Scene
- Params/Variables:
  - bird: Physics sprite with gravity
  - pipes: Physics group
  - score: Number tracking points
  - pipeTimer: Event for pipe spawning

- Functions:
  - constructor():
    - sends GameScene to super

  - create():
    - Generates birdTexture (gold circle) if missing
    - Generates pipeTexture (green rectangle) if missing
    - Sets up input handlers (pointerdown/spacebar) to call flap()
    - Sets score counter to 0
    - Initialize scoreText
      - position top
      - fontSize 32
      - color black
      - depth 10
    - Configures collision between bird and pipe to call gameOver()

  - flap():
    - Applies -300 vertical velocity to bird

  - spawnPipes():
    - Creates pipe pair with 150px gap
    - Positions pipes at random vertical location
    - Sets horizontal movement (-200px/s)
    - Marks pipes as unscored

  - update():
    - Checks for bird out of bounds
    - Updates score(+0.5 each pipe) when pipes pass bird
    - Rounds score to integers for display

  - gameOver():
    - Stops physics and pipe spawning
    - Applies red tint to bird
    - Restarts scene after 1 second delay

- Constants:
  - Pipe gapSize: 150
  - Bird gravity: 800
  - Pipe spawn interval: 1500ms
  - Pipe velocity: -200px/s
  - Flap force: -300 velocity
