/**
 * This interface serves as a placeholder for the verification logic related to UI actions within Bulifier.
 * In this open source version, [CoreUiVerifier] is kept as a dummy implementation, allowing developers
 * to extend or modify it based on their needs while maintaining transparency.
 *
 * The production version of Bulifier includes additional features that are not part of the open source version:
 *
 * - **Backend to proxy OpenAI requests**: OpenAI's policy does not allow direct collection of developers' API keys,
 *   so a backend is used in production to securely handle these requests.
 * - **Subscription Management**: Subscription services are included to manage different tiers and access levels.
 * - **Analytics**: Used to collect usage data to help improve the app and understand user behavior.
 * - **Crash Reporting (Crashlytics)**: Integrated to monitor app stability and quickly address issues.
 *
 * Gazman Dev LLC is dedicated to keeping the core business logic of Bulifier open source. By excluding these production-specific features,
 * we aim to provide a transparent and flexible core version that developers can explore and extend as they wish.
