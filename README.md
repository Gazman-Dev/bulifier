Bulifier is an open-source project that leverages AI to revolutionize software development, introducing a new intermediary language based on bullet points. The project aims to bridge the gap between human logic and AI-generated code, making mobile-based development a reality.

## Key Concepts

- **Bulify**: Convert your ideas into structured bullet points.
- **Debulify**: Transform bullet points into various output formats (e.g., Python, Java, or prose).
- **Rebulify**: Update existing bullet point files with new features or modifications.
- **Schema Management**: Create and update schemas to customize Bulifier for your specific needs.

Bulifier envisions a future where developers focus on high-level logic while AI handles the code generation, allowing software development to shift from laptops to mobile devices.

## New Feature: Schema Management

Bulifier now allows you to update existing schemas and create new ones, unlocking a whole new realm of possibilities:

- **Personalized Project Scopes**: Incorporate your project scope directly into the schema for tailored content generation.
- **Diverse Content Generation**: Create schemas for various content types like books, documentation, and more.
- **Customizable Developer Schemas**: Pre-defined schemas for code writing can be updated to suit your needs.

### How to Use Schema Management

1. **Manual Creation**: Create new schema files manually for custom content types.
2. **Bulk Updates**: Use the new update-schema schema to modify all schemas at once.
3. **Schema Customization**: Tailor the update-schema schema itself for even more flexibility.
