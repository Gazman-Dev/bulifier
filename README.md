Bulifier is an open-source project that leverages AI to revolutionize software development, introducing a new intermediary language based on bullet points. The project aims to bridge the gap between human logic and AI-generated code, making mobile-based development a reality.

## Key Concepts

- **Bulify**: Convert your ideas into structured bullet points.
- **Debulify**: Transform bullet points into various output formats (e.g., Python, Java, or prose).
- **Rebulify**: Update existing bullet point files with new features or modifications.

Bulifier envisions a future where developers focus on high-level logic while AI handles the code generation, allowing software development to shift from laptops to mobile devices.

## Getting Started & Contributing

This is a fully functional Android project. Start by running the demo module.
