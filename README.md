## What Makes Bulifier Special? ‚ú®

Ever wished you could code from your phone as easily as writing notes? That's exactly what we've built! Bulifier transforms the way you develop software by letting you express your ideas in simple bullet points. Our AI then turns those bullets into proper code.

Here's what you can do:
- **Bulify** - Write your ideas as bullet points (way more fun than it sounds!)
- **Debulify** - Watch as your bullets transform into Python, Java, or whatever you need
- **Rebulify** - Need to update your code? Just modify your bullets and regenerate
- **Schema Magic** - Create custom templates for different types of projects
- **Git Integration** - Manage your code repositories right from your phone

## Ready to Try It? üöÄ

## Cool Features You'll Love üí°

### Git Support
We've baked in Git support so you can manage your code right from the app:
- Clone repositories
- Pull and push changes
- Switch between branches and tags
- Commit your work
- Reset when things go wrong

(Just a heads up - we don't handle merge conflicts yet!)

### Make It Your Own
Bulifier is super flexible. You can:
- Create custom schemas for different types of projects
- Update existing schemas to match your style
- Use it for more than just code - try writing docs or books!

## Let's Make Bulifier Better Together ü§ù

We built Bulifier because we believe coding shouldn't be limited to laptops and desktops. If you're excited about this vision, we'd love your help! Feel free to:
- Submit pull requests for small improvements
- Open issues to discuss bigger changes
- Share your ideas and feedback

## Technical Notes üîß

We're using Firebase as a backend proxy for AI requests (OpenAI doesn't allow public API keys). Don't worry though - all the business logic is client side and part of this repo!
