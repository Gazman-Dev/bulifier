# Bulifier

Bulifier is an innovative open-source project that aims to transform software development by leveraging AI and introducing a new intermediary language based on bullet points. It's designed to bridge the gap between human logic and AI-generated code, potentially moving development from laptops to mobile devices.

## Core Concepts

Bulifier introduces three primary actions:

1. **Bulify**: Convert your ideas into structured bullet points.
2. **Debulify**: Transform bullet point files into various output formats (e.g., Python, Java, or prose).
3. **Rebulify**: Update existing bullet point files with new features or modifications (not yet implemented).

## Key Features

- **Bullet Point Language**: A logical, English-based structure for expressing complex ideas.
- **AI Integration**: Leverages AI to interpret bullet points and generate code or other outputs.
- **Mobile-First Development**: Aims to enable software development primarily on mobile devices.

## Vision

Bulifier's vision is twofold:

1. Transition from traditional coding to writing logical bullet points that AI can interpret and transform into code.
2. Enable mobile-based development by reducing the need for extensive typing and leveraging conversational AI.

## The Future of Development

Bulifier proposes a future where:

- Developers focus on logic and high-level concepts rather than low-level implementation details.
- AI handles boilerplate and repetitive coding tasks.
- Human creativity and innovation remain crucial, even as AI capabilities advance.

## Getting Started

It is a fully working Android project. Start by running the demo module.
